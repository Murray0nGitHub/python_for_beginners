#When you go out to eat, you always tip 20% of the bill amount.
#But who’s got the time to calculate the right tip amount every time? Not you that’s for sure!
#You’re making a program to calculate tips and save some time.

#Your program needs to take the bill amount as input and output the tip as a float.


bill = int(input())
tip = bill*20/100

print(tip)
